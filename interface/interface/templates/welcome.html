      Perception of Musical Groups
    </h3>
    <p>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the ways in which listeners distinguish groupings in music. A group may be formed by a number of factors including temporal proximity, timbral or dynamic contrast, register, and pitch contour. Rather than isolating each of these parameters, we presented participants with excerpts of actual music in order to see how parameters compete and exert primacy in the grouping process. The data will have two primary uses. First, it will contribute to the cognitive psychology literature that seeks to explain how we make distinctions and connections in musical experience. Second, we plan to use our data in machine learning algorithms to determine if a machine can generalize our data in order to determine groupings in examples not previously heard. Such a system would be useful both as a tool for composers to learn their musical preferences and tendencies and as part of a system that allows musical robots to improvise with humans.
